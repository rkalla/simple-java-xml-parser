Description
-----------
A very small (4 classes) abstraction layer that sits on top of the XML Pull 
Parser spec (http://xmlpull.org/) to provide a namespace-capable XML Parser with
the ease-of-use of XPath with the performance of a native pull parser.

SJXP was designed to work on any Java platform, including Android.

This library supports parsing 2 types of data from an XML source:
* Character data (text between tags)
* Attribute values

Parsing rules are defined as a series of XPath-esque "paths" pointing at
elements or attribute names, for example the following rule would point at the 
<title> tag inside the <item> tag of an RSS feed:
/rss/channel/item/title

Additionally, the library supports parsing namespace-qualified entities using a
simple [] notation with the namespace's URI, for example:
/rss/channel/item/[http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/]creator

Where the "creator" tag is defined as <dc:creator> inside of the RSS feed, and
the "dc" prefix is mapped to the "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" namespace
URI. 

Unfortunately, supporting the use of the 'prefix' in parse rules is too fragile
as plenty of documents in the wild remap "well known" prefixes to their own
custom names, like remapping the "dc" Dublin Core prefix to "core" or "dublin"
that I have seen a few places. 

To ensure parsing correctness, this library opted for explicit namespace URI 
qualifications.


Performance
-----------
Below are a range of test cases I used to benchmark the parser. I have tried to
include a range of files so you can most closely predict the performance with
regards to your intended use.

You can run all these tests yourself, just look for the Benchmark suite inside
the /src/test folder. 

[Platform]
* Java 1.6.0_24 on Windows 7 64-bit 
* Dual Core Intel E6850 processor
* 8 GB of ram

[Examples]
1.	Hacker News Feed - 10 KB, 30 stories
	Parsed: Title and Link elements
	news.ycombinator.com/rss

2.	Bugzilla Bug Feed - 132 KB, 128 comments
	Parsed: <who name=""> attribute and <thetext> elements
	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35973

3.	New York Craigslist Feed - 278 KB, 100 listings
	http://newyork.craigslist.org/sss/index.rss

4.	TechCrunch Feed - 300 KB, 25 stories
	feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch

5.	Samsung News Feed - 500 KB, 100 stories
	www.samsung.com/us/function/rss/rssFeedItemList.do?typeCd=NEWS

6.	Eclipse XML Editor Stress Test File - 1.63 MB, 1054 additionallineitem entries
	https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=136935

7.	Example Dictionary XML - 10 MB, 41,427 <w> entries
	http://www.cs.umb.edu/~smimarog/xmlsample/

[Results]
1. Processed 11061 bytes, parsed 60 XML elements in 7ms
	ELEMENTS: <title> and <link>

2. Processed 132687 bytes, parsed 258 XML elements in 50ms
	ELEMENTS: <who name=""> and <thetext>

3. Processed 278771 bytes, parsed 200 XML elements in 61ms
	ELEMENTS: <item rdf:about=""> and <description>
	
4. Processed 303726 bytes, parsed 50 XML elements in 41ms
	ELEMENTS: <title> and <link>
	
5. Processed 724031 bytes, parsed 300 XML elements in 58ms
	ELEMENTS: <title>, <link> and <description>
	
6. Processed 1633334 bytes, parsed 2108 XML elements in 219ms
	ELEMENT: <quantityandweight> (from <additionalitem>)
	
7. Processed 10625983 bytes, parsed 41427 XML elements in 412ms
	ELEMENT: <w> (from the /dictionary/e/ss/s/qp/q path)
	
NOTE: If all these tests are run back-to-back such that the running VM gets
"warmed up", the performance is roughly 2x what it is from a cold-run, which is
how I ran the tests above.

Here is the output of the Benchmark class when all tests are run together:
1. Processed 11061 bytes, parsed 60 XML elements in 7ms
2. Processed 132687 bytes, parsed 258 XML elements in 33ms
3. Processed 278771 bytes, parsed 200 XML elements in 143ms
4. Processed 303726 bytes, parsed 50 XML elements in 9ms
5. Processed 724031 bytes, parsed 300 XML elements in 19ms
6. Processed 1633334 bytes, parsed 2108 XML elements in 120ms
7. Processed 10625983 bytes, parsed 41427 XML elements in 241ms


Example
-------
Defining a rule (instance of IRule) is as simple as using the DefaultRule class
and added an impl for either of the two handler methods (1 for ATTRIBUTES and 1
for CHARACTERS). 

Here is an in-line example used to parse RSS2 feeds:

	new DefaultRule(Type.CHARACTER, "/rss/channel/item/link") {
		@Override
		public void handleParsedCharacters(String text) {
			count++;
		}
	}
	
You pass that to the XMLParser constructor and you are off to the races parsing
links out of an RSS feed at the speed of light!


Runtime Requirements
--------------------
If you are deploying this library inside of an app to Android, you only need to
include the sjxp JAR; it will utilize whatever underlying XML Pull Parser impl
is provided by the platform.

If you are deploying this library inside of any other kind of app in a Java
runtime, be sure to include the xpp3-1.1.4c.jar file that contains the XPP3
XML Pull Parser implementation (one of the fastest parsers).


History
-------
This project was born out of 6 months of working on RDF, Atom and RSS 1 & 2
parsing using XML pull parsing; hand-editing and writing test cases against
well over 400 test feed documents from around the web in every language.

Common themes arose and many eye-opening experiences of how broken some "valid"
feed markup can be in addition to how sloppy some specs are with regards to
required format.

Spending all that time, I saw a lot of common themes and simplifications that
boiled down to the same fundamental problems over and over again. At the time
I wrote a fairly complex layer that sat on top of Sun's XML Pull Parser, but
soon realized that the fundamental problem could be distilled, yet again, down
to something even simpler and faster.

This library is the final result of all that work.  


Troubleshooting
---------------
Here are some issues you might run into and what you can do to correct it.

* I get the following exception while parsing:
	===
	org.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException: processing instruction can not have 
	PITarget with reserveld xml name (position: START_DOCUMENT seen \r\n<?xml ... @2:7)
	===
	
	This is a frustratingly vague exception; it is caused by your <?xml..?> 
	directive at the beginning of your XML file having whitespace before it. If
	you remove the whitespace, you should be fine (apparently it is against the
	spec to have whitespace).
	
* I am getting no parsed values from an RDF feed doc (like Slashdot.org's feed),
why?

	This can be unexpected, especially if you haven't spent a lot of time with
	name spaces and XML docs. The RDF doc *probably* defines a default namespace,
	in the case of the Slashdot.org feed example, it does. Up in the header, you
	see "xmlns=", that means every element reference you make needs to be qualified
	with the namespace URI; something like this:
	/[http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#]RDF/[http://purl.org/rss/1.0/]channel
	
	instead of what you were probably trying:
	/[http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#]RDF/channel
